> An **undefined** variable has no value. 

```js
var foo;
```

With the `var` keyword, we're *declaring* a variable, but until a value is assigned to it, it's undefined.

```js
var foo; // returns undefined
```

If you don't declare the variable with `var`, it's still undefined.

```js
anotherThing; // returns undefined
```
