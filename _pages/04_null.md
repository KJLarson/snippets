> **Null** is a value that represents nothing.

```js
var foo = null;
```
Null is the *intentional* absence of any value. It represents something that doesn't exist, and is not any of the other data types. 

```js
var empty = null;
```

The difference between null and undefined is rather subtle, but the main distinction is that null is an intentionally empty value.
