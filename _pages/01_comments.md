Comments are notes written in plain English with the purpose of explaining code. Although comments don't technically perform any function in the program, it's crucial to get into the habit of proper documentation to help you or future collaborators understand the intent of your code.

### There are two types of comments in JavaScript:

- A **single line comment** is written as two forward slashes `//` followed by the comment.
- A **multi line comment** is placed between `/*` and `*/` and can span many lines.

```js
// This is a single line comment.

/* This is
a multi-line
comment. */
```
