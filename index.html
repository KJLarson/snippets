<p>A JavaScript reference guide.</p>

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the programming language used to make websites dynamic and interactive. It's a **client-side** programming language, which means the code gets executed in the user's web browser. With the advent of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and other technologies, it can also be used as a **server-side** language, making it extremely versatile. JavaScript is used primarily for **front-end web development**, and works closely with HTML and CSS.

> **Note:** Java is not JavaScript. It's a different language with a confusingly similar name.

### Requirements

You already have the prerequisites to start writing and using JavaScript. All you need is a **web browser** to view the code, and a **text editor** to write it. The browser you're currently using is perfect (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc). Your computer comes preinstalled with Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac), but I would recommend installing [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), which are free programs specifically designed for coding.

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is a website that allows you to write code and make live demos, and it will be the easiest way to start following along and practicing.

### Basic Terminology

A programmer writes programs, just as an author writes a book. 

A **program** is just a set of instructions that a computer can read and use to perform a task. Each individual instruction is a line of code known as a **statement**, which is similar to a sentence in a book. While a sentence in English ends with a period, a JavaScript statement usually ends in a semi-colon. **Syntax** refers to the symbols and rules that define the structure of the language, similar to grammar and punctuation, and the semi-colon that ends a JavaScript statement is part of the syntax.
