<p>A JavaScript reference guide.</p>

<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

<p>JavaScript is the programming language used to make websites dynamic and interactive. It's a <strong>client-side</strong> programming language, which means the code gets executed in the user's web browser. It can also be used as a <strong>server-side</strong> language, making it extremely versatile. JavaScript is used primarily for <strong>front-end web development</strong>, and works closely with HTML and CSS.</p>

<blockquote> <strong>Note:</strong> Java is not JavaScript. It's a different language with a confusingly similar name.</blockquote>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

You already have the prerequisites to start writing and using JavaScript. All you need is a <strong>web browser</strong> to view the code, and a <strong>text editor</strong> to write it. The browser you're currently using is perfect (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc). Your computer comes preinstalled with Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac), but I would recommend installing [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), which are free programs specifically designed for coding.

<h3>Basic Terminology</h3>

A programmer writes programs, just as an author writes a book. 

A <strong>program</strong> is just a set of instructions that a computer can read and use to perform a task. Each individual instruction is a line of code known as a <strong>statement</strong>, which is similar to a sentence in a book. While a sentence in English ends with a period, a JavaScript statement usually ends in a semi-colon. <strong>Syntax</strong> refers to the symbols and rules that define the structure of the language, similar to grammar and punctuation, and the semi-colon that ends a JavaScript statement is part of the syntax.
